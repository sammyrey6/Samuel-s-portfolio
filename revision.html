            <h2>What are my motivations?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a young coder trying to learn more and aquire new assets under my belt inorder to become successful. I want to learn as much code that I can and hopefully delv into other languages so that I can make accessible and innovative apps for any platform.

            <h2>What do I aspire to be?</h2>
            <p>
                I am not trying to be the best coder like many other try to be but I am trying to be the most versatile. Like the saying goes, "A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."
