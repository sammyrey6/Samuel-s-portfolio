            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Samuel Carag and I am learning to become a web developer through the UCLA bootcamp. I am currently working as a host at a restaurant and as a reservist for the Marine corps. I am currently based in Southern California near Los Angeles and have past experience in aviation maintence.

            <h2>What are my motivations?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a young coder trying to learn more and aquire new assets under my belt inorder to become successful. I want to learn as much code that I can and hopefully delv into other languages so that I can make accessible and innovative apps for any platform.
            </p>

        <div id="social-media-marketing" class="social-media-marketing">

            <h2>What do I aspire to be?</h2>
            <p>
                I am not trying to be the best coder like many other try to be but I am trying to be the most versatile. Like the saying goes, "A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."
